# Algorithm Implementation: Intersection-Traffic-Control

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm described in:

W. Wu, J. Zhang, A. Luo and J. Cao, "Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithms for Intersection Traffic Control," in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 65-74, Jan. 2015, doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2013.2297097. keywords: {Vehicles;Algorithm design and analysis;Trajectory;Traffic control;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms;Concurrent computing;Mutual exclusion;intersection traffic control;intelligent transportation system;vehicular ad hoc network;distributed algorithm},

This implementation includes modifications, including parallelisation, that are not present in the original paper. These modifications are the original work of Jesse Cruickshank.

This code is currently for academic/research purposes only. Please contact the author for permission before using or distributing.
